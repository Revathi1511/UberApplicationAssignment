# UberApplicationAssignment
For the UberApplication i have Code-First Migrations to create our database, and WebAPI and LINQ to perform CRUD operations.
For this Database i have created 3 tables one with Car database, Driver database and Riders database where we have all the data for users, rides, drivers and cars
With this database the idea is to link each table with ride databse , Keeping in mind both the car and the Driver database are individual database.
For the car database i have created a CRUD function wher the driver can view the list of cars available and they can create,update, edit and delete function.
The same is implemented for drivers table.I have created a CRUD function in the same where the user can add, edit,delete the driver name
